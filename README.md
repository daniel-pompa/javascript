# Basic and Advanced JavaScript Concepts

What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions. Known as the programming language for Web pages, but it is also used in many non-browser environments. It is a scripting language that is dynamic, multi-paradigm, prototype-based and supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.

JavaScript runs on the client side of the web and can be used to program how web pages behave when an event occurs. JavaScript is a powerful scripting language and easy to learn, widely used to control the behavior of web pages.

## Description

This repository contains a collection of exercises to practice and understand basic and advanced JavaScript concepts. It covers topics such as variables, data types, arrays, objects, functions, flow control structures, classes, DOM manipulation, imports and exports, the Fetch API, and asynchronous programming. It includes examples to help you understand and practice these concepts in JavaScript.

## Requirements

It is necessary to have installed:

A source code editor such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or any other editor you like.
